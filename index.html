    <h3>Professional web developer </h3>
    <p>Hi! I’m a web developer and I love all things tech. When I’m not knee-deep in code, I’m probably reading up on the latest development trends or practicing my sketching (or both).

        I got my start in technology as a self-taught coder, and since then I’ve never looked back. I specialize in front-end development, but I have a little bit of experience with everything from coding to QA to project management.
        
        I’m always looking for new challenges and opportunities, and I’m excited to see what the future holds for me in the world of tech. Thanks for reading! </p>

            <p>When it comes to writing my technical bio, I like to use strong, descriptive language to show off my skills. For example, I might say that I have “extensive experience with ReactJS” or that I’m a “expert in Python web development.”

                Using powerful words like this helps me stand out from the crowd and makes it clear that I’m a serious contender for any job. So if you’re looking to make a great impression with your bio, be sure to use strong language to describe your skills! </p>
